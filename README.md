# Jordan's React Portfolio!

## Description

This is my React portfolio â€“ a project where I dove headfirst into React, learned how to deploy it on Netlify, and even got my feet wet with three.js. Each page is like a different planet, a testament to my journey in web development. Take a look around and explore the various planets I've put together!
